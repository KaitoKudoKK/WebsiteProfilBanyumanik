  - text: "In the past, this hamlet was inhabited by only 12 families, known as Toyamanik. The name comes from the words 'toya', meaning water, and 'manik', meaning eye. This name refers to the well located to the west of the hamlet. The well was so deep that it resembled an eye bead. Later, during the reign of Gunungkidul Regent Darmakum Darmakusuma, the name 'Toyamanik' was changed to 'Banyumanik'. This change was made following a recommendation to discontinue the use of Javanese Krama terms as the official name for the hamlet."
  - text: "Apart from history, there are oral stories among the Banyumanik people. In the story it is said that Banyumanik is known as an area that experiences water shortages. Then, when Wali Sanga stopped in the area, they intended to make a river flow as a water source in Banyumanik. However, before the work was finished, the sound of a rooster crowing was heard, indicating that morning had come. Suddenly, the water flow reversed direction and returned to Ngingrong Cave."
